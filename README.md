# Deploy Hugging Face Models on AWS SageMaker

This repository demonstrates how to deploy Hugging Face models, including open-source and LLMs (Large Language Models), on AWS SageMaker. The guide covers the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project, from setup and training to deployment and MLOps.

## Features

- **AWS SageMaker Studio**: End-to-end environment for machine learning development.
- **Instance Selection**: Efficient usage of CPU/GPU instances with cost management.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Deploy pre-trained models like `DistilBERT` and Falcon B-40B.
- **Inference Endpoint**: Set up and test APIs for real-time predictions.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling and advanced infrastructure support for large models.
